## Introduction
This implementation is not intended as ``just another'' alternative metaverse platform but serves three critical purposes: i) validating the proposed standards through practical applications, ii) creating an open platform that can be offered to the community, and iii) acting as a source of insights and suggestions for extending the standards themselves.

## Builds
The project was developed and tested using [**Unity 2021.3.x (LTS)**](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2021.3)
